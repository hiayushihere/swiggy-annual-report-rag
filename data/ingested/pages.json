Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in\n2024\u201325 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project,\nand strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4\u00be percent on average,\nboosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing\nreforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will\nlikely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.\nWith lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in\n2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5\u00bd percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses\nmoderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar\u2019s LNG production expands massively,\nboth the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share\nof GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall.\nBanks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to\n20 percent and return on equity of 14\u00bd percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024.\nSince the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks\u2019 net short-term foreign liabilities,\nbanks\u2019 non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average\nmaturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio\nremained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is\nrelatively high at above 80 percent.\nQatar has started to implement the ambitious Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) to\nbuild a more diversified, knowledge-based and private sector-driven economy. Guided by\nNDS3, reform momentum has strengthened significantly, including to attract and retain high-\nskilled expatriate workers, foster innovation, promote public-private partnerships, and further\nimprove the business efficiency. Qatar is well positioned to leverage digitalization and AI for\nproductivity gains, and the nation\u2019s climate agenda is advancing.\nRisks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Main downside risks stem from the global\nheadwinds, including a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in\nglobal financial conditions and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical\ntensions. The regional conflict has had limited impact on Qatar but adds further to the\ndownside risks through lower tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon\n1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff\nteam visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments\nand policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.",

    "text": "QATAR\nSTAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION\nJanuary 8, 2025\nKEY ISSUES\nContext: Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued with signs of\nactivities strengthening more recently. Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to\nlower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform\nmomentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3).\nOutlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium-\nterm outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and\nreform gains. Fiscal and external surpluses will likely remain but moderate. Qatar has so far\nbeen resilient to the regional conflict, with risks to the outlook being balanced overall.\nQatar\u2019s strong policy buffers can help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks.\nFiscal policy: The authorities\u2019 commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The\npositive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to\nintroduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending\nefficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient\nspending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term\nfiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will\nenhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency\nand risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy.\nMonetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country\nwell. Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the\nrecent IMF technical assistance. Continued diligence to safeguard financial stability and\nformalizing the financial safety net are critical. Promoting more stable domestic funding\nthrough market deepening initiatives would help reduce banks\u2019 exposure to short-term\nforeign funding. Strong efforts to improve AML/CFT effectiveness should continue.\nStructural reforms: Successful NDS3 implementation requires proper reform prioritization\nand inter-agency coordination. Priorities include to enhance human capital and innovation,\npromote trade diversification and FDI (with domestic knowledge spillovers) and further\nimprove business efficiency, especially access to finance. Qatar is well positioned to\nleverage digitalization and AI for productivity gains. Accelerating climate actions can\nstrengthen sustainability and generate \u201cgreen\u201d growth. Policies targeting specific sectors or\neconomic zones should be managed carefully. Statistics should continue to improve.",

The regional conflict has had\nlimited impact on Qatar, but adds further to the downside risks with potential impact through lower\ntourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon prices.

Over the medium and long term, the expected\nsignificant expansion of global natural gas supply could exert downward price pressures, although\nQatar\u2019s low production cost and proven reliability could mitigate the impact (Text Figure 8).3 Other\nkey downside risks include worsening climate stressors and a disorderly global energy transition.

In 2019, Qatar released its first National AI Strategy,\nfocusing on education, data access, employment, business, research, and ethics. The AI Committee,\nestablished in 2021, coordinates efforts from ministries, universities, and financial institutions. A $2.5 billion\nAI investment package was announced in May 2024. AI-related research has also surged. Overall, Qatar is\nclose to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart).\nIncreasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market.\nCurrently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade),\ncomparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent). Building on IMF (2023)2 staff\nanalysis suggests that about 75 percent of the high AI exposure jobs in Qatar have high\n\u201ccomplementarity\u201d\u2014workers in those jobs are more likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains than\nbeing replaced.

    "text": "QATAR\nBox 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact (concluded)\nThe private sector has played an important role in shifting Qatar\u2019s labor market toward a more\nfavorable position for AI adoption. Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the\nlast decade, but the number of technicians and professionals\u2014two job categories with high AI exposure and\ncomplementarity\u2014has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country's potential to\nbenefit from AI adoption.\n\u201cEnabling clusters\u201d identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching\nthe occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with\nthe AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure\nand complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the \u201cgrowth clusters\u201d identified in NDS3\u2014\nmanufacturing, logistics, and tourism\u2014tend to have more limited AI exposure.\nScenario analysis points to potential gains in labor productivity from AI penetration in Qatar. Staff\nanalysis suggests that, under an optimistic scenario where successful reforms to enhance human capital,\ninnovation and private sector growth allow a more rapid increase in the share of jobs exposed to AI and\nfaster AI adoption (than under the baseline), labor productivity growth could be lifted by an average of 1 ppt\nannually (above the baseline) over the medium term.\nLabor Productivity by AI Scenarios\n(Million GDP per worker)\n0.5\nPessimistic\nBaseline\n0.4 Optimistic\nVery optimistic\n0.3\n0.2\n2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025 2027 2029\nSources: IMF staff calculations.\n1 This box summarizes key findings in the Selected Issues Paper \u201cArtificial Intelligence in Qatar: Assessing the Potential\nEconomic Impacts.\u201d\n2 Pizzinelli et al. 2023, \"Labor Market Exposure to AI: Cross-country Differences and Distributional Implications\"\nAuthorities\u2019 Views\n34. The authorities concurred with staff\u2019s call to accelerate structural reforms, and noted\nthat a large number of initiatives and projects were underway guided by NDS3. The newly\nestablished National Planning Council highlighted its role in prioritizing reforms, ensuring inter-\nagency coordination and monitoring progress. The authorities agreed with staff recommendation to\nfocus reforms on boosting human capital and innovation, enhancing the business environment,\nattracting FDI and promoting exports. They agreed that Qatar was well placed to leverage AI for\nproductivity gains, and highlighted Qatar\u2019s comparative advantage in energy cost and reliability to\nattract data centers, around which an ecosystem could be built to enhance domestic value added.\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27",

From\nNDS1 (2011-16), NDS2 (2018-22) to NDS3 (2024-30), Qatar\u2019s diversification strategy has gradually\ntransitioned from a public sector-driven, infrastructure-focused approach, to one that empowers the\nprivate sector to build a more dynamic and innovative economy (Table 1). NDS3 aims to leverage\nQatar\u2019s strengths built over the last decade, including large financial resources, enhanced human\ncapital, and high-quality infrastructure. The strategy lays out a systematic approach for economic\ntransformation, with ambitious targets set.\n2. NDS3 highlights Qatar\u2019s progress made since the launch of the Qatar National Vision\n2030. Substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and\ninstitutional development. In particular, Qatar has achieved solid economic growth during 2008\u201323\n(average 5\u00bd percent), with the share of non-hydrocarbon economy rising by more than 10\npercentage points (ppts) to 63 ppts. Qatar\u2019s education and health systems, labor market including\nfor expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements.\n3. NDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar\u2019s\ndiversification journey. Qatar\u2019s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC\ncountries, especially in fiscal revenue and exports. NDS3 acknowledges relatively low non-\nhydrocarbon output growth in recent years with declining labor productivity, its costly diversification\nmodel driven largely by public sector spending with implications for fiscal sustainability, and\nincentives that hinder private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Skilled and\nhighly skilled employment rose (including both nationals and expatriates) but the majority remains\nless skilled. NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an\nimmature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further\ntransformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic\ndiversification.\n4. NDS3 stresses that the state should become an \u201cenabler\u201d of more vibrant and\nsustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close\nremaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the\nneed to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through\nadditional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to\nfacilitate private sector participation. It also identifies \u201cdiversification clusters\u201d to build comparative\nadvantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes.\n42 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND",

External Sector Assessment\nOverall Assessment: Qatar\u2019s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately\nstronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained\nrobust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In\n2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical\nlevels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to\nprogressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in\nthe pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current\naccount gap is expected to continue narrowing.\nPotential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged\nunder NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap.\nFiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and\nspending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the\nexternal position in the medium term.\nForeign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory\nBackground1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and\nlarge asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities\nside, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but\nrose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central\nbank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023.\nAssessment. On the asset side, QCB\u2019s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are\nestimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023\u2014they will continue to be supported by the\nprojected current account surpluses over the medium term. On the liabilities side, a moderate level of\nexternal public debt contributes to strong overall fiscal debt sustainability (Annex IV. Fiscal and Debt\nSustainability Assessment). Commercial banks\u2019 external liability remained broadly unchanged, leaving the\nnet foreign liability relatively large.\nGross Assets:\n2023 (% GDP) NIIP: NA QCB Res. Assets: 24.2 Gross Liab.: NA Debt Liab.: 123\nNA\nCurrent Account\nBackground. The current account surplus fell from a decade high in 2022, by nearly 10 percentage points of\nGDP to 17 percent of GDP in 2023. Hydrocarbon prices normalized and in late-2023 hydrocarbon export\nvolume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance\noutflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus\nremained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and\nimports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is\nthus expected to abate somewhat to 16\u00bd percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15\u00bd percent of\nGDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high,\nalbeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices.\n46 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND",

Nowcasting of Non-hydrocarbon GDP Growth in Qatar\nThis Annex applies nowcasting, which has been widely used for near-term growth projections, to\nQatar\u2019s real non-hydrocarbon output growth, with several innovations. Results fit historical data well\nand point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth trough. A few caveats related to the\nmachine-learning approach for nowcasting are also discussed.\n1. Nowcasting generates real-time forecasts for key economic indicators where the\nofficial data may be unavailable or delayed by analyzing high-frequency macroeconomic\nindicators. For example, Qatar publishes GDP data with a lag of around 2-3 quarters, while policy\nmakers and businesses may need a more timely\nFigure III.1. Qatar: Nowcasting Concept\nassessment of the economy to inform policy and\nbusiness decisions\u2014nowcasting is an effective\ntool to fill the gap. This technique is particularly\nsuitable where high-frequency indicators are\nabundant and published timely, as in the case of\nQatar. Nowcasting models are also highly\nadaptable\u2014they can be updated regularly with\nnew data, ensuring that the estimates remain\nrelevant and accurate amidst changing Source: IMF staff calculations.\neconomic conditions.\n2. A nowcasting model for Qatar\u2019s non-hydrocarbon economy is developed, based on\nprevious IMF work (Barhoumi, Karim, et al. 2022, Akbal, Faruk, et al. 2023), following the steps\nbelow:\n\u2022 Select predictive variables. A wide range of economic and financial indicators are selected to\ncapture domestic, regional and global conditions that could affect Qatar\u2019s non-hydrocarbon\neconomy. These variables are chosen based on criteria such as predictive power (i.e., suggested\nby the pairwise correlation between the predictive variable and Qatar\u2019s non-hydrocarbon GDP),\ndata availability, and minimal lag time. A balance is maintained between the number of\npredictors and the size of the training data (used to fit nowcasting models with historical trends)\nto avoid overfitting \u2013 a situation where the model is too \"tailored\" to the training data and fails\nto generalize to other situations, leading to inaccurate predictions.\n\u2022 Select nowcasting models. The selected time series data are processed through advanced\nmachine learning algorithms (see below). A variety of models, including Support Vector\nMachines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Elastic Net, are trained by historical data. Each model's\nperformance is evaluated using a range of metrics (e.g., out-of-sample root-mean-squared error\n(RMSE)), and the best-performing models are selected for further analysis.\n\u2022 Identify contributions of predictive variables. Shapley decomposition is applied to break\ndown the contribution of each variable to the nowcast results. This method allows us to pinpoint\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 49",

By identifying the\nkey drivers, we can refine and iterate on the model to improve accuracy and reliability over time.\nFigure III. 2. Qatar: Project Overview\nSource: IMF staff.\n3. A few innovations have been introduced to Qatar\u2019s nowcasting framework to optimize\nthe variable and model selections:\n\u2022 A big data approach in variable selection is developed to enhance the coverage of potential\npredictors of economic growth and reduces the lag between real-world events and nowcasts.\nUnlike traditional methods that select variables based on specific economic theories, this\napproach collects a large number of variables including those that are unconventional in\neconomic analysis, and evaluates their correlations with Qatar\u2019s non-hydrocarbon GDP.\nSpecifically, a Stata program is developed to scrape the Haver and CEIC databases, identifying\nrelevant keywords in millions of data series. The keywords target data specific to Qatar and its\nkey trading partners. The program chooses 1,300 Qatar-specific series and 1,200 series related\nto Qatar\u2019s trading partners for further selection. For the 2,500 variables, pairwise correlations are\nrun against Qatar\u2019s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Those with the highest correlations (both positive\nand negative) are kept. Judgement based on economic theories and knowledge of the Qatari\neconomy is then applied to ensure balanced sectoral coverage, narrowing the final pool to\n13 variables. Further refinements of variable selection can be done by conducting Shapley\ndecomposition of nowcasting results to identify contributions from different predicative\nvariables and iterate with alternative variables.\n\u2022 Machine learning (ML) models are applied to handle large and complex datasets. Unlike\ntraditional methods such as statistical models and surveys, ML models allow for better\nintegration of complex, non-linear relationships between economic variables that ARIMA models\nmight miss due to their linear structure and reliance on smaller, time-series data. ML models can\nalso adapt to changing patterns in data more efficiently than statistical models. They can learn\nfrom outliers, non-stationarity, and other irregularities, potentially yielding more accurate and\ntimelier GDP nowcasts.\n50 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND",

Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high and commitmen\nto, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support low fiscal and debt risk. The large reserves of natural gas, cleaner than\nother browner fossil fuels, is likely to play a key role in a smoother energy transition, and strong financial buffers (including from the\nsovereign wealth fund, QIA) can provide support if downside risks materialize. The projected non-hydrocarbon primary balance\n(NHPB) is broadly consistent with the benchmark guided by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) in the long term (see the main\ntext of the Staff Report). The authorities are in the process of producing own actuarial studies on the sustainability of the pension\nsystem.\nSource: Fund staff.\nNote: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through exceptional measures (such as debt\nrestructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures\u2014that do not involve a debt\nrestructuring\u2014to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing.\n1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only cases or in cases with precautionary IMF\narrangements, the near-term assessment is performed but not published.\n2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt\nsustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only cases or cases with IMF arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability of\nsustainable debt (\"\"with high probability\"\" or \"\"but not with high probability\"\") is deleted before publication.\n54 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND",

Continued fiscal discipline is assumed, the debt level is expectec\nFanchart Low wee to decline further, and the QIA holds substantial financial assets.\n\nGFN Low\n\nStress test\n\nLong term se Low Long-term risks are low supported by the QIA\u2019s large financial assets,\nmanageable aging-related and social security expenditures, and strong\nnatural gas reserves. As the cleanest fossil fuel, natural gas will likely\nplay a key role for a smoother energy transition relative to fossil fuels\nwith higher emission. Qatar's production cost is low. These together\nsupport sizeable revenues over a long term.\n\nNot required for Sustainable\nsurveillance with high Not applicable\ncountries probability\n\nSustainability\nassessment 2/\n\nDebt stabilization in the baseline Yes\n\nDSA Summary Assessment\n\nCommentary: Qatar is at a low overall risk of sovereign stress. Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high and commitmen\nto, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support low fiscal and debt risk. The large reserves of natural gas, cleaner than\nother browner fossil fuels, is likely to play a key role in a smoother energy transition, and strong financial buffers (including from the\nsovereign wealth fund, QIA) can provide support if downside risks materialize. The projected non-hydrocarbon primary balance\n(NHPB) is broadly consistent with the benchmark guided by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) in the long term (see the main\ntext of the Staff Report). The authorities are in the process of producing own actuarial studies on the sustainability of the pension\nsystem.\n\nSource: Fund staff.\nNote: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through exceptional measures (such as debt\nrestructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures\u2014that do not involve a debt\nrestructuring\u2014to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing,\n\n4/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only cases or in cases with precautionary IMF\narrangements, the near-term assessment is performed but not published.\n\n2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt\nsustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only cases or cases with IMF arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability of\n\nsustainable debt (\"with high probability or \u2122but not with high probability\") is deleted before publication.\n\n54\n\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\n\n",

The statistics authority is in the process of producing new supply\nand use tables to improve the consistency of GDP estimates. A household survey is being finalized, which will be used to update CPI weights. The domestic \"FDI ecosystem\u201d\nhas been fully mapped to identify additional sources of input data including business registration platforms (.e., QFC, QSTP, QFZA, Media city) which will increase survey\nframe from current 130+ entities to 2000+ entities.\n\nCorrective actions and capacity development priorities. Enhance awareness across government entities of the data gaps and international best practices. Implement\nrecommendations made by the above-mentioned TAs. Encourage the authorities to seek the Institute for Capacity Development (ICD) training, additional Statistics\nDepartments (STA) TAs, and participate in the workshop on the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to be organized by the newly established Riyadh Regional\nOffice. Urge the National Planning Council and National Statistics Center to coordinate efforts across relevant government entities on statistics including consolidation of\nscattered data, submission to the IMF, and broader publication.\n\nUse of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. |IP data are unavailable, including QIA\u2019s assets under management. Staff\nrely on different data sources as needed\u2014it estimates external debt data (for non-bank private sector and public sector debt outside of the central government), uses\nalternative data sources for FDI, and relies on commercially available bank-level data.\n\nOther data gaps. A more granular forward-looking calendar of key data releases would aid surveillance and enhance transparency. By maturity assets and liabilities data\nand by sector non-performing loans (NPLs) data will enhance the assessment of banking sector risks for surveillance. Data on enterprises, particularly small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs), and on climate change adaptation and mitigation would help inform surveillance.\n\n66 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\n",

After a very strong economic performance in 2022, boosted by the successful hosting of\nthe 2022 FIFA World Cup, output growth has normalized in 2023 and 2024, with recent signs of economic activities\nstrengthening at the end of 2024, notably in the tourism sector. Qatar's inflation has been generally declining\nthroughout 2023 and 2024. The medium-term outlook is positive, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion\nand by reform efforts which are expected to intensify under the upcoming Third National Development Strategy as\nwell as under the Third Financial Sector Strategy (3FSS) which is also expected to provide impetus for a sustainable\ngrowth. Qatar\u2019s strong fundamentals and significant policy buffers would help mitigate any negative impact in case\ndownside risks materialize.\nFiscal Policy\nThe State of Qatar\u2019s low public debt, significant fiscal and external buffers, and the longer-term benefits and returns\nof the authorities\u2019 investment plans for future generation are remarkable. The authorities continue to be fully\ncommitted to a prudent fiscal policy that aim to optimize the use of Qatar\u2019s resources by improving spending\nefficiency and mobilizing non-oil revenues, all whilst promoting sustainable growth and preserving\nintergenerational equity. The 2024 budget was focused on allocating resources for the third National Development\nStrategy (NDS3) and supporting efforts to diversify the economy. The general budget continues to focus on\nachieving the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030 related to the development of human capital by focusing on the\nhealth and education sectors \u2013 with the allocations for the two sectors constituting 20% of the total budget - in\naddition to the goals related to diversifying the local economy and enhancing its competitiveness.\nThe authorities are committed to a sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework supported by\ndiversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 targets include to reach a fiscal\nsurplus of 5\u00bd percent of GDP (way above the past five-year-average of 3 percent), maintain the current sovereign\ncredit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and achieve manageable expenditure growth. The government plans\nto reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, and enhance debt management through\nframeworks including sovereign green financing. The authorities intend to continue addressing underlying spending\ninefficiencies and diversify fiscal revenues notably through implementing the corporate income tax Pillar II in line\nwith the global timeline. The 2025 budget envisages broadly prudent spending plans and aims for a medium-term\nexpenditure-based fiscal consolidation. The authorities have made good progress in expanding program-based\nbudgeting to eventually cover all sectors by the end of 2025 and expect that the ongoing expenditure review would\ngenerate savings in the medium term. Moreover, the authorities plan to enhance their macroeconomic projections\nto support the medium-term budget update. The authorities view the fiscal risks from ongoing PPPs, mainly on\noperating and maintaining existing infrastructure, to be minimal.",
